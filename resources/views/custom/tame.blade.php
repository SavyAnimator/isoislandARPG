<h1>Taming Companions</h1>

    <p class="mb-2"> Some Island Inhabitants are not the kindest and easiest to become acquainted with, but that is not stopping some Isomara. Although still referring to these island creatures as companions, they are more thought of as domesticated foes. Whether they be the predatory Memics or the elusive Memoras, Isomara will try to form a partnership with these normally unfriendly creatures.</p>

    <div class="a" align="justify">
        <p>
            To tame certain companions they must go through a process of domestication. The companions must be taught how to behave in and around Isomara society without them being a threat. To do so Isomara must go through rigorous acts to befriend them and gain their trust.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="a" align="justify">
        <p>
            Each potential companion needs to go through a set number of mini-prompts with an Isomara before they can become official companions with any. Below are the mini-prompts for each individual companion.

                                        <h4>Memora Taming Mini-Prompts</h4>
                                        <p><u>Requires:</u> Two (2) mini-prompts to be completed to tame a Memora</p>
                                        <p> Memoras are venomous and aggressive animals. Unlike Gooms, who are not very threatening, Memoras have stingers which can greatly harm an  Isomara if the Isomara is not careful. <br> While a single Memora can't take down an Isomara alone, as their venom is not strong enough for such a large creature, multiple Memoras can endanger an Isomara. <br>In essence, Memoras can be dangerous and it's wise to be taught how to care for them before considering them a friend. </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>I. Memoras are fast creatures; they run and swim in fast sprints to help them catch prey. If they're going to respect you, you need to be quick! Draw or write your Isomara keeping up with them!</li>
                                            <br><li>II. Memoras are picky eaters, but this one seems rather hungry. Bring them something delicious to eat, like some fish!</li>
                                            <br><li>III. Ahh, it appears you've upset this Memora! They are enraged, flailing their stingers and hissing. Be careful not to get hurt! Draw or write your Isomara reacting to and maybe calming down the Memora! </li>
                                            <br><li>IV. All this excitement and new experiences have worn the Memora out; you should let them rest! Despite being spiky and venomous, they can be very cuddly. Or they might get upset with you if you disturb their rest! Draw or write about your Isomara reacting to the tired or napping  Memora!</li>
                                            <br><li>V. Oh!! What a wondrous moment! The Memora has rolled onto their back and offered their tum for pets! But, it could also be a trap for them to bite you if you stick your hand there! What will you do?</li>
                                            <br><li>VI. Memoras are pack animals, but if you're the only one around; you have to make yourself useful if you're going to stay! They're intelligent and can see potential in Isomara's creations, even if they want nothing to do with it. Draw or write about your Isomara impressing the  Memora! </li>
                                            <br><li>VII. After a long day of hunting, swimming, and exploring, Memoras like to settle down and ensure they're clean.  They're pretty flexible creatures, but there seems to be a spot on their back they can't reach! Maybe you could help? Be cautious though, you could startle them. Draw or write about your Isomara helping clean the  Memora!</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h4>Memic Taming</h4>
                                        <p><u>Requires:</u> Three (3) mini-prompts to be completed to tame a Memic</p>
                                        <p> One of the greatest threats to an Isomara are Memics. They disguise themselves to get close and attack their prey. Memics have an unnerving drive to attack whatever living thing is closest. <br> Memics are not to be toyed with, they are smart hunters and it is this motivation and skill that piques the interest of many Isomara. Utilizing a Memic's eggs,  feathers, and even saliva to benefit them is one thing, but having a steady source of those, and what if they could even get Memics to become docile enough to keep around and protect Isomara, that could change everything!</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>I. A Memic mimics you, so why don't you try mimicking it? Draw/write about your Isomara and the Memic hunting together. Did you spot some prey, did you learn anything from shadowing the creature?</li>
                                            <br><li>II. Although they seem ravenous, Memics often spend much of their day basking in the sun and napping. Take a break with the Memic and rest with it.</li>
                                            <br><li>III. Looks like you'll need to teach the big bird how to find other meals to eat that are not Isomara. Draw or write about your Isomara teaching the Memic what it can and/or cannot eat.</li>
                                            <br><li>IV. Making great strides you think, but let's see how quick a Memic is to turn on you. Draw or write about your Memic coming in contact with an untamed Memic. Does your Memic attack or even try to protect against the wild one or does it join with the other and combo attack your Isomara?</li>
                                            <br><li>V. It is time to get your Memic to socialize with other Isomara. Hopefully, everything goes well. Depict the Memic meeting other Isomara.</li>
                                            <br><li>VI. Stay! This is what you say as Carmen reluctantly accepts to help you tame the Memic. Draw or write about your Memic playing nice with some eggs and Carmen.</li>
                                            <br><li>VII. Bleppers are known to be related to Memics and perhaps a Memic's instincts and attitude could change if they took after their erm... simpler-minded cousins. Have your Memic play with some Bleppers.</li>
                                        </ul>
