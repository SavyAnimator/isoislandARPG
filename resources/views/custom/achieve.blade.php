<h1>Achievements [WIP]</h1>

<h5>Character Acheivements</h5>
<p class="a" align="justify">

    Achievements are collectible badges for your Isomara which you can collect and earn. They are mainly cosmetic collectible, however some achievements may give your Isomara perks and bonuses.
    Each Isomara can earn all the achievements. As new ones get added you can refer back to this journal to gain them on your Isomara.

    Achievements will be auto-added to your Isomara's ID depending on how they are earned (For example the Goom Races can earn you some achievements that are added when prizes are rewarded at the end of each race week).
