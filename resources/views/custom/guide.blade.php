<h1>Beginner's Guide: Getting Started</h1>

<h4 class="mb-0">Welcome to the Island!</h4><img src="{{ asset('images/SlayExplains.png') }}" width="340px" class="float-right"/>
    <p class="mb-2">"I'm Slayer, the tour guide, I am going to take you through the basic information of the ARPG such as my species (Isomara), and things you can do on the Island. My job is to broaden your knowledge, give advice, and answer any questions. Make sure to read this guide if you are ever in need of help or do not know what to do next.
    If you have any questions you want quickly answered head over to our  <a href="/reports/bug-reports">support center</a>. Be sure to check out the  <a href="/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> first though.</p>
        <br>

<h4 class="mb-0">What are Isomara?</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">Isomara (Eye-so-mare-ah), or for short Isos, are semi-aquatic mammals with huge paws and manes and are often classified as dragons. They have feathered wings and large rounded canine teeth. They are sentient creatures with the ability to use tools, farm, herd, and even tame local fauna. They are tribal creatures who live rather simple lives. Isomara typically live in colonies which are not run by any individual but instead is formed and ran through the word of the wise. Typically older Isomara have a larger influence than younger, however, younger Isomara often get a large say in matters as they can bring forth new ideas into the society.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">Isomara are the primary playable characters of the game. Aside from Isomara, there are other species on the island that members can own such as Gooms and Memora. These other species are referred to as companions and help give buffs and benefits to Isomara. Not all activities in this ARPG require an Isomara there are some games and activities which only companions can partake in.

<h4 class="mb-0">The Main Island</h4>
    <p class="mb-2">Isomara make their home on a large Island away from any other bodies of land. The area of the island is roughly 490,000 squared miles (about 1,269,000 squared kilometers).<br>
    The island has no formal name, but smaller areas of land around the island sometimes do have names given to them. One smaller island of which is called Pelemoku and another Fross. One popular and important activity within the ARPG is <a href="/explore">exploration</a> of the island and there is also <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/isomara-island/journal/Activity-Voyaging-723078861">voyaging</a> an activity that challenges Isomara to roam outside the confines of their home island and into the vast unexplored world.</p>
